The walls of this cave are dump and mossy.
There is a corps of a fellow golden scales seeker lying on the floor.
Thousands pairs of red eyes are looking at you from the darkness.
There is a dim blue light coming from the top of the cave.
You hear a subdued squeaking from another side of the cave.
The floor of the cave is covered with beautifull flowers of different colours and shapes.
The air in this cave is very dusty.
It smells bad here.
The walls of the cave are covered with unusual ancient carvings.
There is a dining table in the middle of the cave filled with exquisite dishes.
There is a huge deep hole in the floor.
